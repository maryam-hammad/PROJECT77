<p> Visual Studio is a software where you can code and program websites WITHOUT
 internet or network. The way this works is you have to download this on your
 own computer(Which means using storage) instead of going to a website. To
 check the output, you choose a browser to display the output and "Go Live" and
 it will display the output on Chrome, or Microsoft Edge, whatever you choose!</p>

<p>The console is there to display the output of the operation you have programmed
 in the website. For example, if you have programmed a calculator, it will show the 
 answer in the console section. To open the console, you right-click on the
 screen, click inspect, and then click the "Console" section. </p>
